        ### **Overview**

        **Goal: Access "smart money" investor data to identify compelling investments in biotech.**

        **My Process:** This project democratizes institutional biotech fund activity by systematically tracking quarterly trends. 
        We parse and analyze 13F-HR filings once per quarter to identify newly-owned companies, shifts in fund participation, 
        and macro trends in biotech investment.

        **Defining Biotech "Smart Money":** Investment funds with 60%+ biotech exposure, 5â€“100 biotech positions, and more than $50M in AUM.

        **The Key Insights:**
        - Newly owned companies by biotech funds
        - Changes in fund participation
        - Trends in public biotech investment        

        ### **About the Author**
        - PhD scientist, entrepreneur, and investor
        - 4 years in venture capital and early-stage drug discovery
        - 15 years investing in public biotech companies
